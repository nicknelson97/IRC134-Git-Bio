My name is Dominick Nelson and I am currently a student at Seattle Central College. I'm studying for a degree in computer science, although I don't know where I want to go with it yet. 
I only recently moved to Seattle, and I'm still getting used to living in such a big and busy city.
My hobbies include hanging out with my cat, walking around and taking in the Seattle scenery, and playing games with my friends and girlfriend.
